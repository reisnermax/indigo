Welcome to my personal website!

I love gaining powerful new insights about why people behave one way, rather than another. I am a behavioural scientist. I’ve lived ,worked and studied in Germany, Sweden, France and Spain and I am proud to call Sydney my home for the last couple of years.

I am currently doing my PhD in Economics at [UTS Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au). I have specialized in Behavioural and Experimental Economics but I double in Development Economics and Applied Microeconomics. My research interests range from how to help the poor overcome their self-control problems using commitment devices to digital in-app nudges in the private banking sector to improve credit card repayment. I have been involved in field experiments in the Philippines and Rural Bangladesh.

I have not just laboured over chalkboards throughout my entire career but I have worked extensively within the industry. I have worked in the behavioural economics team of [CommBank](https://www.commbank.com.au) helping to gain powerful new insights, data- driven and evidence-based, to improve Australians’ [financial wellbeing](https://www.commbank.com.au/personal/newsroom/financial-wellbeing-scales.html).

In my free time you find me out in the deep blue ocean, whether that’d be surfing, spearfishing or just exploring some new beaches. 

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in collaborating, need help with a project or just want to go for a surf.
